# About me

 - I have experience with Java, Python, Dart, and a little bit of assembly and C.
 - The majority of my coding experience has come from class projects. I started out writing small, single-function programs and worked my way up to more complex projects.
 - The largest program I've worked on is my CS222 Final Project - an application that retrieves and displays nutrition information from the USDA online database.
 - I feel most comfortable writing small scripts and programs in Java.
 - I still don't feel very confident in my refactoring abilities and my Python skills are a bit rusty.
 - My concentration is in Data Analytics and Machine Learning.
